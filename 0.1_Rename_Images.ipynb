    "# Renaming USDA Oat Images\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook renames the images taken from an oat study over the summer of 2021. A for loop was used for each date directory to copy the image to a new date directory and labeled with the correct plot number and row. Date 7/22 was skipped because it just had soybean images. Date 7/8 was already labeled so it just needed to be copied. \n",
